####Flooding Events in the United States, Present to 2045

The Earthâ€™s average temperature has warmed by more than one degree Fahrenheit over the last century, most of this warming comes from human influence. Carbon dioxide from fossil fuels accumulates in the atmosphere causing the greenhouse effect that warms the planet.

This impacts on global weather systems, causing everything from unexpected rainfall, extreme heat waves, and flooding events.
Nowadays, many cities across the country and around the world are being affected by this problem. This won't stop and the consequences could be worst in the next 30 years.

Here is how much flooding events can increase in the main cities of the US.

Is in our hands to take action now on the problem to built a more sustainable future.
